# MappingYourSteps
Android Studio Project

-------------------------
## Introduction 
Here we have a project for an Android Device. This is a school project, don't expect to have more than the most needed functions, as there won't be a lot of them. 

Before you code something out, consider the guidelines [Here](CONTRIBUTION.md)

## What kind of project?
This project will be a step-counter with geolocation, where you can see your actual position and the steps you've done. Other features like the distance in kilometers will be avaiable as we see fit. Because of the high amount of data we create, we are going to use a database. 

## Features
Here are the features listed in two different categories. Non-functional and functional, whereas the first one describes features which aren't technically or not a part of a function. 

### Functional
- Geolocation
- Step-counter and step-detector
- Track is viewable 
- Steps from startpoint to endpoint

### Non-Functional
- Time (From A to B)
- Track-length divided by number of steps
- Persistent
